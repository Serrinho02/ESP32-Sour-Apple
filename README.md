The exploit causes the device to crash (works fastest while it is locked on the homescreen).

This script was tested with and at the time of writing, works on every iPhone.

The iPhone starts to freeze after a few seconds of it getting spammed with BLE pairing requests. After a random looking amount of time the iPhone turns completely black and you can now force restart it (Volume UP, Volume Down, Hold power button), or, alternatively, wait for it to restart by itself.
